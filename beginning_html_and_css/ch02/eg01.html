<p> This book focuses on the latest version of the language, popularly referred to as
    <mark>HTML5</mark>
    . There are two other versions you might encounter. These are HTML 4.01, the last major versions of the language
    from December 1999 and a stricter version from 2000 called XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language). XHTML is
    still very popular in some applications so important differences between it and
    <mark>HTML5</mark>
    will be called out in
    the text.
